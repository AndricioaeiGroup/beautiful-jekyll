We are a research group interested in theoretical chemistry and computational molecular biophysics affiliated 
with the [Department of Chemistry](https://www.chem.uci.edu/) in the [School of Physical Sciences](https://ps.uci.edu/) of the University of California, Irvine.
Our research explores theoretical topics at the interface between molecular biophysics and physical chemistry. 
It hinges on a two-fold central theme: 
(1) developing novel theoretical techniques and 
(2) applying computer and modeling methods to describe, in terms of dynamics and thermodynamics, biologically important 
molecular processes, with the aim to explain or predict experimental findings. Research directions include:

### Enhanced Sampling in Trajectory Space.
Many important equilibrium and kinetic properties of chemical systems (including proteins and nucleic acids)
can be cast in terms of paths in multi-dimensional spaces.
Sampling and optimization algorithms we have developed for the conformational space can be generalized and
adapted to the space of paths. We see fertile ground for theoretical and computational work on several categories of paths,
from chemical-reaction paths to paths in the sequence space of evolving proteins.
We have developed a set of trajectory reweighting techniques based on a stochastic path integral formalism that is
particularly useful to treat both computer simulations and single-molecule experimental traces.
